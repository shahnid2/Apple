    While Kafka allows only one consumer per topic partition. 
    But, there is no explicit limit on the number of consumer groups that can be instantiated for a particular topic 

 {"Hi Nidhi"}>>>>>>>[TOPIC 1] >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> [NODE A] 
                              >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> [NODE B]
                              
  Consumer Group:  CG1
      members:
        NODE A
      offset: 001
  Consumer Group:  CG2
      members:
        NODE B
      offset: 001
      
      



**/ How would you initialize this to bean - ANSWER - @BEAN
 interface Person{
   public void doSomething();
 }


 class User implements Person{
   public void doSomething(){
  
   }
}
